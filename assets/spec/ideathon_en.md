## Intro

There is a wallet that allow the exchange of monetary values without the need for private key management.

But this is not just a wallet for transactional functions.

## Content

This wallet is a portfolio wallet that consolidates the information that forms one's identity in the blockchain world, including DID, wallet address, VerifiableCredentials, and NFT.

In addition, it is envisioned to enable the registration and management of DIDs, which are not familiar to humans, under an easy-to-understand name as the DID Name Service.

As the number of transactions on the blockchain increases, Social Identity tokens will be granted, which can be used for money transfers.

The more connections you have with others, the more your score will increase, which will be converted into a score in the blockchain domain.

It is a wallet where activity itself is structured as a portfolio.

The problem it solves and the value we want to provide with this app

The application frees the user from complicated private key management and provides a portfolio wallet that manages identity information!

If you work while owning this wallet, you can form a self-sovereign portfolio!

The NFTs and Verifiable Credentials issued as certificates through casual exchanges and memorials will become a part of your identity.

## Challenges

1. We challenge you to implement a DID version of ENS.

2. We challenge to implement an algorithm for scoring with Social Identity tokens.

## Technologies

1. ERC20

2. ERC721

3. ION

4. DID

5. Verfiable Credentials

6. Express

7. React.js

8. Truffle

9. Pinata API

10. ethers.js

11. Block SDK

12. ContractWallet

13. AWS KMS

## The part to be implemented at ETH Tokyo

Data linking will be implemented with smart contracts.

â†’ We would like to make the score increase as more tokens are issued and more connections are made, in addition to the data linkage.

Blockcerts will be used to issue and verify Verifiable Credentials.

DID issuance and anchoring will be implemented using ION.

The DID Name Service will be implemented in the form of an NFT contract.

SIT will be implemented as an ERC20 token.

In addition, this wallet is basically designed to have an architecture that does not require users to manage their private keys.

Users can authenticate using only their email address and use the application.

It is assumed that the app will run in a browser and will not be dependent on the type of device.
